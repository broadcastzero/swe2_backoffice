This solution is created for education purposes.

Standard git commands:

git commit -am 'mycommitmessage' => select changes for committing and leave a commitmessage
git push origin master => upload committed changes to repository

git pull origin master => get up-to-date files from repository

if git pull leads to message: error - local changes would be overwritten,
make sure to save all important stuff you did since your last pull, and then:

git stash save .
git pull origin master
git stash drop <<doubletabulator>>
